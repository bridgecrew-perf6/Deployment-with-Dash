# Deployment with Dash ðŸŽ®

## The Mission

Games obsessed manager has a nice little side project for you: vizualize some interesting aspects about his poorly scraped steam data. He's managed to compile a json file containing data on some 1000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront steam.

He'd like you to show him a proof of concept to translate data, visualize said data and deploy a little server so he can see if it is worth investing more time in.
So, in these case I tried to clean data visualize it and create a frame with flask.

Data sets are cleaned at Jupyter Notebook and created a dash with plotly. When we compare dash with Flask, it is more user friendly and easier to use.


#### Which dataset?

Orijinal dataset placed on repo(Deployment-with-Dash) by name ``` database.json ```
